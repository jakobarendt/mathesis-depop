# Introduction

\[Motivation:\]

-   Economic dimension of population developments: Cities often provide better infrastructure and have higher GDP per capita compared to their rural counterparts within the same country **source for that?!?**
-   Consider IPCC AR6 synthesis report: Urbanisation and city growth increase people's vulnerability towards climate changes consequences (e.g. exposure to heat extremes and precipitation runoff intensity). If it can be concluded that, on the other hand, climate change also causes population shifts from rural to urban areas, this might lead to self-perpetuating, "vicious", cycle. Iterates need to consider further adaptation and mitigation measures to break this cycle.
-   Understanding of relationships between climate and population developments is essential for developing adequate and well-targeted policies that respond efficiently to the already ongoing and future climate change
-   A great part of investments in public infrastructure, whether be it for schools, hospitals, transport or something else, takes place in densely populated areas. Likely, these areas also often dominate the considerations for adapting such infrastructure to increasing temperatures, more extreme weather events and other consequences of climate change. By showing that rural areas are equally or even more vulnerable to climate change than their urban counterparts, I am able to underscore their significance when deciding where to allocate resources for climate change adaptation.
-   One/two sentences about the remaining strucuture of the thesis. "The remainder of this thesis paper is organized as follows..." (do not forget to mention the appendix) OR "The chapter following this introduction..."

\[Research question / Overall perspective:\]

-   How has climate shaped (or: influenced) European municipal population figures since WW2?

\[Further notes for myself:\]

-   mention *IPCC reports* when discussing urgency of climate change as a topic in public debate (i.e. consequences/scenarios when no actions are taken)
-   **Social outcomes** as key word
-   unobservables differentiating spatial units and also correlated with weather/climate may cause bias - use of panel model should help to correct for this
