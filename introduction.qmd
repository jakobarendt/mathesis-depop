# Introduction

-   mention *IPCC reports* when discussing urgency of climate change as a topic in public debate (i.e. consequences/scenarios when no actions are taken)
-   **Social outcomes** as key word

**Motivation:**

-   Economic dimension of demographic developments: Cities often provide better infrastructure and have higher GDP per capita compared to their rural counterparts within the same country **source for that?!?**
-   Understanding of relationships between climate and demographic developments is essential for developing adequate and well-targeted policies that respond efficiently to the already ongoing and future climate change
