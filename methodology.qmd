Isolating climate information either from weather data or a model of the climate is a non-trivial task.
Similarly non-trivial is identifying the causal impacts that climatic states described by such information can have onto societal and economic outcomes.
The following sub chapter entails a quick overview of what common climate-related identification problems look like and what econometric research designs have mostly been applied to them.
After that, the sub chapters describe the specific identification problem of this study, and then argue for and specify the research design chosen for this problem.

## Common Approaches in Climate Econometrics

In his comprehensive survey article of climate-related econometric methodology, @hsiang-2016-climate-econometrics provides a formal definition of climate, that underlies many empirical studies that relate climate to economic and societal variables.
In essence, climate is described by a vector $\mathbf{C}_{i \tau}$ consisting of $K$ relevant parameters indexed by $k$ that characterize a joint probability distribution $\psi ( \mathbf{C}_{i \tau} )$.
In theory, a vector $\mathbf{v}_{it}$ of random variables of weather conditions relevant to economic and societal outcomes (e.g. temperature or precipitation) at any time point $t$ within time period $\tau = [ \underline{t}, \overline{t} )$ and in space $i$ could be drawn from this distribution, such that

$$
\mathbf{v}_{it} \sim \psi ( \mathbf{C}_{i \tau} ) \quad \forall \, t \in \tau .
$$ {#eq-climate-distr}

In other words, climate is the parametrization of the joint distribution $\psi ( \cdot )$ of which certain states of weather could realize during time period $\tau$ and at place $i$.
**(mention theoretical counterparts to c and v??)** Ultimately, the goal of the econometric research design would then be to find an appropriate description of the theoretical parameter vector $\mathbf{C}_{i \tau}$, and to use it to then estimate their effects onto any the outcome variable in question.

A multitude of consequences follow from this definition: First, the expected distribution of weather realizations $\psi ( \mathbf{C}_{i \tau} )$ can never be parametrized by its empirical counterpart $\psi ( \mathbf{c}_{i \tau} )$, that characterizes observed weather states $\mathbf{v}_{i, t \in \tau}$.
After all, the observed states could have also realized differently from the theoretical distribution.
The advantage of this definition is that it allows for climate parameters to be derived from theoretical or numerical models such as reanalyses.
Second however, the fact that true climate is not known does not imply that observed weather cannot be used to estimate climate impacts.
After all, the realized weather characteristics $\mathbf{c}$ are still realized of climate characteristics $\mathbf{C}$, mathematically put $\mathbf{c} ( \mathbf{C} )$.
This consequence might be the most important as it provides the foundation for identification of climate effects from weather data and variation.

## Questions

-   Reverse causality? More populated areas are likely to have higher surface temperatures, but this cancels out with the hypotheses that hotter LAUs have population reductions, right?
