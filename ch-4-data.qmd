# Data

The empirical analysis of the effect of climate change on population size in rural areas relies on two main data sets: Historical climate data and historical population data.
The essential characteristics of these data sources are described in this chapter.
However, both of these data sets come with peculiarities, that require further separate cleaning and preparation before joining them together and using them in the panel analysis.
The steps undertaken for their preparation are described more extensively in @sec-AppxPopData and @sec-AppxWeatData, analogously.
The spatial join of the two data sets, that relates the LAUs' historical population data with the weather data on the basis of their geographic locations, is discussed in the last of the following sub-chapters (@sec-SpatialJoin).

## Historical LAU Population Data Set

<!-- Specify states more exactly -->

The source of the historical population data for European LAUs is Eurostat.
The data includes LAUs of European Union (EU) member states, certain candidate and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, as well as the United Kingdom, and can be downloaded from its website [@eurostat-2023-lau-website].

Since LAUs are (public) Local Administrative Units, their structural and geographic compositions are subject to adjustments as local, national, and European policies change.
For this investigation in particular, reforms of administrative boundaries can highly complicate the analysis of the LAUs' population figures because the statistical units lose inter- and intra-unit comparability over time when their spatial dimensions change.
Additionally, census time points vary among countries and regions, which complicates cross-section comparability as it requires unified time points.
The creators of the data set took this into account and estimated harmonized population figures to enable further analysis and research.

Due to the above-mentioned continuous changes of the administrative boundaries of the LAUs throughout time, their boundaries were fixed to the base years 2011 or 2012 to allow for comparability across time points.
Frequency and scope of reforms of administrative boundaries was diverse among countries.
For this reason, the techniques chosen to harmonize the population figures with respect to their spatial attributes \[(geopositions?)\] vary with the country and in two cases even with the region (Germany and the UK).
For example, while for some countries a backward approach adjusting only the figures subject to known boundary changes was applied, for others spatial overlay of decade-specific boundary maps was necessary.
Special cases, for instance where two LAUs were combined to a single one, are also labeled with footnotes pointing to metadata distributed alongside the data tables.
The report of the data collectors outlines this in more detail @gloersen-luer-2013-report-data-collect.
<!-- no interpolation here!! -->

Besides space, the second dimension that needed harmonization to ensure comparability is time.
Expectedly, countries did not collect their census data at the same points in time.
Instead, the creators of the data set aimed to collect LAU population figures for at least one year in each decade of the years 1960 to 2011.
While figures for some countries were exactly on or only few days apart from the proposed reference dates and could be used directly, others had to be estimated with a geometric interpolation method.
Finally, population data for the reference dates January 1st of 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011 were derived.

In addition to the estimated figures for harmonization along with the original ones, the data is also delivered with geographic references such that the population figures can be integrated into maps and other spatial analyses.
For the majority of the countries, these references correspond to the *EuroGeographics EuroBoundaryMaps* \[provide citation\] of the year 2011/2012, as the population figures were harmonized for 2011/2012 LAU boundaries.
However, some countries' LAU population figures are delivered with different geographic referencing systems, for which the maps (more precisely, their shapefiles) are provided.
Similarly, there are also exceptions regarding the spatial level of detail: For most countries, the population figures are geographically referenced to the LAU2-level that has a higher spatial resolution, but for some countries population data could only be estimated for the coarser LAU1-level.
@tbl-lau-levels-maps gives a complete overview of these aspects.

\[Further notes to myself for historical population data:\]

-   Quote here the Eurostat guidance on rural and urban typologies
-   And maybe some other definition to determine which LAUs are rural and not (UN? ILO? Commission? DG AGRI? DG EMPL, ask Paola?)
-   Think about where to mention the different base years in this subchapter. Also reference Appendix A for this!!
-   LAU-2 level: Highest resolution of Eurostat regional typology)
-   Add another column to table denoting whether bias due to spatial overlay may be present
-   Add another column to table denoting for each country the year for which its boundaries have been recalculated (either 2011 or 2012) --\>

## Weather Data

\[Discuss in this sub-chapter:\]

-   **Resolution of raster** 0.1 deg, mention also what that would be equivalent to in km (for different latitudes)
-   Raster is balanced panel of weather data (it provides repeated observations for the same units, i.e. grids, throughout multiple time points)
-   Briefly discuss publisher of the data (ECMWF), consider further information from the documentation of the grid, in particular:
    -   The number of stations that provide data for the grid and its interpolations/reanlyses and whether there were significant changes in distribution and total amount of stations
    -   Reanalysis or original station data and interpolated where needed?
    -   How is station data interpolated? (Station data is complemented by interpolation for those locations without station or with missing weather data points)
-   Mention which weather parameters are downloaded: Temperature, precipitation etc

Disadvantages of weather grid data according to @auffhammer-etal-2013-weather-data-econ-analysis: **attenuation bias** (in particular for points 1, 2 and 5)

1.  Many weather grid data products are similar in average temperatures for each of their grids, but they differ greatly in variance from these means.
2.  Measurement errors caused by spatial interpolation done by averaging for regions with missing data.
    -   Likely less of a problem for this investigation, Europe still has one of the highest densities of weather stations
    -   Rather an issue for selected areas of the grid, in particular for regions in Europe with high prevalence of weather fronts, high variance of territorial surface heights or any other circumstances causing consequential differences of weather states within a grid cell at the same time point
    -   **Important consequence:** A bias in measurement error towards more rural areas!
3.  Lack of full set of weather variables/failure to include other weather variables can lead to indeterminate OVB as correlation among different weather variables varies greatly depending on location.
4.  Spatial correlation in weather data grids can lead to multicollinearity in econometric estimation, in turn overestimating standard errors for weather variable coefficients.
    -   Only a problem for cross-section estimation? Or also for panel data?
5.  Unwanted exogeinity from artificial variation and breakpoints in weather data time series, caused by anthropogenic changes in weather station availability and other changes in methodology, strategy and management of weather data measurement and recording.
    -   Mainly a problem when investigating smaller geographic areas.
    -   Criterion: Weather station coverage does not change with (policy) intervention; here: Population figure changes should have no connection to changes in weather station coverage, i.e. might only be noticeable in countries and regions with profound and sudden systemic change such as former east block

## From Weather Data Variables to Measures of Climate and Climate Change

\[Discuss in this sub-chapter:\]

-   How are the different weather parameters aggregated on the time dimension to correspond to the time points of historical population data:
    -   "Classical" approach with decade averages of yearly mean temperature, yearly precipitation sum, and potentially other parameters?
    -   Alternatively, consider variability-based indicators (but probably more likely to measure short-term responses)
    -   Consider measures suggested in @roberts-etal-2012-agronomic-weather-measures as examples for how to aggregate weather data

\[Put main parts of chapter *Common Approaches in Climate Econometrics* in this chapter?\]

Main points from @auffhammer-etal-2013-weather-data-econ-analysis:

-   Climate as long average of weather at given location (difference between weather and climate a matter of time)
-   Differentiation between climate responses (explained by climate normals, e.g. long averages in cross-sections) and short-run weather elasticities (explained by short-term weather fluctuations)

## Mapping Climate onto Weather Data and Descriptive Evidence {#sec-SpatialJoin}

\[Discuss in this sub-chapter:\]

-   Compare size of grid (and consequently the size of its area) with the territorial size of the smallest and biggest LAU
-   Mention & cite exactextractr package
-   Provide graphics to demonstrate spatial overlay
