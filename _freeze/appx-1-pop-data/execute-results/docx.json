As the `EPSG:4326` CRS and the `OGC:CRS84` CRS both have the *WGS84* as their underlying reference ellipsoid and only differ in the longitude-latitude order, transforming the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles should not produce any inaccuracies.[^appx-1-pop-data-2]\nHowever, this is not the case for those countries that are special cases and whose LAU boundaries are specified by the separate, non-*EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles: Greece, Ireland and Turkey LAU boundary shapefiles are delivered with the `ETRS89` or `ED50` CRS. When transforming the CRS for these shapefiles to `OGC:CRS84`, some inaccuracies may occur.\n[^appx-1-pop-data-3] However, considering the research setup, the extent of LAUs typically being in the $\\mathrm{km}^2$ range and, in the majority of cases, weather not varying significantly within few meters, I deem those inaccuracies of maximum eight meters as neglegible\n.\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-2]: For more details on transformation of projections and CRS, and potential inaccuracies due to that process, see also the documentation of the command `st_transform()` of the *sf* R package [@pebesma-bivand-2023-package-sf] and the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io].\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-3]: More precisely, the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io] indicates that for Greece (`EPSG:3035`, i.e. `ETRS89-extended`) the boundaries can be off by up to one meter and for Turkey (`EPSG:4230`, i.e. `ED50`) they can be off by up to eight meters, when transforming them to a CRS that has *WGS84* as reference ellipsoid.\n    For Ireland (`EPSG:4258`, i.e. `ETRS89`), the registriy does not indicate any inaccuracies, but they are not expected to be more than those for Greece as they are also `ETRS89`-based.\n\nBesides the issues with transforming LAU boundary shapefiles to a *WGS84*-based CRS, neither the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles nor the weather grid data specify which version of the *WGS84* standard they refer to.\nA point can change in coordinates across different versions of a CRS because of multiple reasons, for example an improved accuracy of the underlying reference datum or ellipsoid, an improved accuracy of the projection, or tectonic shifts.\nYet, similarly to the transformation-induced inaccuracies discussed above, I also consider these inaccuracies caused by potential CRS version differences as minor and neglegible for this work.\nAccuracy improvements and other updates to the *WGS84* standard will have shifted points on its CRS only by some meters at most.\nIn contrast to these downsides, there also some advantages to harmonising to the *WGS84*-based CRS: The weather data and the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles, that cover most countries, use that standard already by delivery, allowing me to avoid inaccuracies that would have come up had I to transform either one of them to the standard of the other or a third one.\nIn addition to that, the tectonic plate-independent coordinate origin of *WGS84* also has the advantage that it allows for consistent localisation of the European overseas territories.\n\nAfter considering the projections, the script then performs various checks and cleaning steps on the shapefiles.\nIt streamlines their unique identifiers (UIDs) to ensure that they correspond to the same format as those in the population figure data set, so they can later be matched together successfully.\nThe script also runs various checks as some columns that seem to contain selected parts of the UIDs are suspected to be redundant.\nThroughout the redundancy checks, it becomes clear that the UID for the Hungarian LAU *Budapest* in v7.0 of the *EuroBoundaryMap* (published in 2012) does not correspond to the UID for the historical population figures of the same LAU nor to the UID in v5.0 of the *EuroBoundaryMap* (published in 2011).\nThe script corrects this accordingly in the v7.0 *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles.\nLastly, it ensures that all data sets storing the shapefiles (*EuroBoundaryMap* v5.0 and v7.0, and separate shapes for Greece, Ireland and Turkey) use the same (or, if required, reasonably different) variable naming, contain only the variables needed for the analysis, and do not have any duplicates in their UIDs.\nBesides the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles (v5.0 and v7.0), all of this processing is also done for the shapefiles delivered separately for Greece, Ireland and Turkey.\nIn addition, I check whether streamlining the shapefiles' CRS as discussed in the paragraphs before was successful.\n\nThe historical population figures data set, which is delivered in an Excel-file, also requires some checks and cleaning.\nThe script first verifies that the country codes embedded in the LAUs' UIDs correspond to those country codes stored in a separate data column.\nDuring that check, I find population data points for two French LAUs that lack an identifier and I remove them.\nIn the script, I also ensure that none of the LAU-wise observations have duplicate UIDs: Only once I find a UID that is used twice.\nI remove the figures of the original observation as well as those for the duplicate since I can not uniquely identify either of the two LAU observations by their natural language name on the map of Europe.\nAs regards the LAUs' UIDs, the script adjusts the identifiers for the Croatian LAUs by extracting their last five digits since I find that only those correspond to the UIDs used in the *EuroBoundaryMap* v7.0 shapefiles belonging to Croatia.\nWhile the population data for the Hungarian capital *Budapest* is provided for the different districts of the city, the shapefiles covering the area of the city are not as granular.\nHence, the script sums up period-wise all the population time series for Budapest to ensure congruence with the geospatial data.\nSimilarly, there is one case in Luxembourg where the historical population data set has more granularity than the *EuroBoundaryMap* v7.0 shapefiles: The shapefiles consider the LAUs *Eschweiler* and *Wiltz* only with their combined boundaries, and therefore the script sums up the population figures of the two for each year.\n@tbl-appx1-pop-data-cleaning lists the countries for which the numbers of LAUs with historical population data changed as a result of the cleaning described in this paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-appx1-pop-data-cleaning .cell tbl-cap='Countries with changes in their numbers of LAUs with historical population data

on joining process and selecting the right base year for each country\\]** Finally, the script joins the *EuroBoundaryMap* v5.0 and v7.0 shapefiles and the shapefiles for Greece, Ireland and Turkey with the historical population figures data set.\n\nThe @gloersen-luer-2013-report-data-collect report on the collection of the historical population figures is somewhat imprecise on whether 2011 or 2012 is the base year for the boundaries which the population figures are referred to.\n\n**\\[add here a table for the amounts of LAU units per country for the raw shapefile and population data, i.e.
