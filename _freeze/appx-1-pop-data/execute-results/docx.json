As the `EPSG:4326` CRS and the `OGC:CRS84` CRS both have the *WGS84* as their underlying reference ellipsoid and only differ in the longitude-latitude order, transforming the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles should not produce any inaccuracies.[^appx-1-pop-data-2]\nHowever, this is not the case for those countries that are special cases and whose LAU boundaries are specified by the separate, non-*EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles: Greece, Ireland and Turkey LAU boundary shapefiles are delivered with the `ETRS89` or `ED50` CRS. When transforming the CRS for these shapefiles to `OGC:CRS84`, some inaccuracies may occur.\n[^appx-1-pop-data-3] However, considering the research setup, the size of LAUs typically being in the $\\mathrm{km}^2$ range and, in the majority of cases, weather not varying significantly within few meters, I deem those inaccuracies of maximum eight meters as neglegible\n.\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-2]: For more details on transformation of projections and CRS, and potential inaccuracies due to that process, see also the documentation of the command `st_transform()` of the *sf* R package [@pebesma-bivand-2023-package-sf] and the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io].\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-3]: More precisely, the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io] indicates that for Greece (`EPSG:3035`, i.e. `ETRS89-extended`) the boundaries can be off by up to one meter and for Turkey (`EPSG:4230`, i.e. `ED50`) they can be off by up to eight meters, when transforming them to a CRS that has *WGS84* as reference ellipsoid.\n    For Ireland (`EPSG:4258`, i.e. `ETRS89`), the registriy does not indicate any inaccuracies, but they are not expected to be more than those for Greece as they are also `ETRS89`-based.\n\nBesides the issues with transforming LAU boundary shapefiles to a *WGS84*-based CRS, neither the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles nor the weather grid data specify which version of the *WGS84* standard they refer to.\nA point can change in coordinates across different versions of a CRS because of multiple reasons, for example an improved accuracy of the underlying reference datum or ellipsoid, an improved accuracy of the projection, or tectonic shifts.\nYet, similarly to the transformation-induced inaccuracies discussed above, I also consider these inaccuracies caused by potential version differences as minor and neglegible for this work.\nAccuracy improvements and other updates to the *WGS84* standard will have shifted its CRS only by some meters at most.\nIn contrast to these downsides, there also some advantages to harmonising to the *WGS84*-based CRS: The weather data and the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles, that cover most countries, use that standard already by delivery, allowing me to avoid inaccuracies present if I would have to transform either one of them to the standard of the other or a third one.\nIn addition to that, using the *WGS84* also has the advantage that it allows for consistent localisation of the European overseas territories.\n\n**\\[add here a paragraph describing the cleaning done for the shapefiles\\]** After these considering the projections, the script then performs various checks and cleaning steps on the shapefiles.\nIt streamlines their unique identifiers (UIDs) to ensure that they correspond to the same format as the population figure data set.\nIn addition, the script\n\n**\\[add here a paragraph describing the cleaning done for the population figures\\]**\n\n**\\[paragraph on joining process and selecting the right base year for each country\\]** The @gloersen-luer-2013-report-data-collect report on the collection of the historical population figures is somewhat imprecise on whether 2011 or 2012 is the base year for the boundaries which the population figures are referred to.\n\n**\\[add here a table for the amounts of LAU units per country for the raw shapefile and population data, i.e. table_obs\\]**\n\n-   Add another column to table denoting for each country the year for which its boundaries have been recalculated (either 2011 or 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Observations (Individ.
