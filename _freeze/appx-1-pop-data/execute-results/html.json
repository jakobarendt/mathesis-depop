As the `EPSG:4326` CRS and the `OGC:CRS84` CRS both have the *WGS84* as their underlying reference ellipsoid and only differ in the longitude-latitude order, transforming the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles should not produce any inaccuracies.[^appx-1-pop-data-2]\nHowever, this is not the case for those countries that are special cases and whose LAU boundaries are specified by the separate, non-*EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles: Greece, Ireland and Turkey LAU boundary shapefiles are delivered with the `ETRS89` or `ED50` CRS. When transforming the CRS for these shapefiles to `OGC:CRS84`, some inaccuracies may occur.[^appx-1-pop-data-3]\\\nHowever, considering the research setup, the surface size of LAUs typically being in the $\\mathrm{km}^2$ range and, in the majority of cases, weather not varying significantly within few meters, I deem those inaccuracies not more than a few meters as neglegible\n.\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-2]: For more details transformation of projections and CRS and potential inaccuracies due to that process, see also the documentation of the command `st_transform()` of the *sf* R package [@pebesma-bivand-2023-package-sf] and the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io].\n\n[^appx-1-pop-data-3]: More precisely, the EPSG simplified registry [@klokantech-2025-epsg-io] indicates that for Greece (`EPSG:3035`, i.e. `ETRS89-extended`) the boundaries can be off by up to one meter and for Turkey (`EPSG:4230`, i.e. `ED50`) they can be off by up to eight meters, when transforming them to a CRS with *WGS84* as reference ellipsoid.\n    For Ireland (`EPSG:4258`, i.e. `ETRS89`), the registriy does not indicate any inaccuracies, but they are not expected to be more than those for Greece as they are also `ETRS89`-based.\n\nBesides the issues with transforming LAU boundary shapefiles to a *WGS:84*-based CRS, neither the *EuroBoundaryMap* shapefiles nor the weather grid data specify which version of the *WGS84* standard they refer to.\nVersion-related differences can have different reasons, for example an improved accuracy of the underlying reference datum or ellipsoid, an improved accuracy of the projection, or tectonic shifts.\n\nBesides the con **Trade-off** distortions due to version differences caused by tectonic movements and other factors vs. inaccuracies in projection of LAUs not on the Eurasian plate (e.g. overseas territories).\n\nHowever, any potential version differences are considered to have little to no influence on this research set up.\nThe dimensions and sizes of the geographical units under investigation are disproportionately bigger than any of the potential datum shifts caused by the differing WGS84 versions.\nBesides, potential misalignents due to tectonic plate movement are unlikely as this investigation focuses on a single continent, and almost all of the investigated land mass lies on the same principal tectonic plates (with Macaronesia and Iceland being only minor exceptions, **are there any other exceptions?? --\\> plot map quickly with leaflet**)\n\n-   Add another column to table denoting for each country the year for which its boundaries have been recalculated (either 2011 or 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Observations (Individ.
