\[Name & differentiate papers by economic subject area/independent variable (e.g. agriculture, conflict, economic growth & activity, migration, productivity, urbanisation) and weather variable\]

**Conflict** @burke-etal-2015-climate-conflict find in their meta analysis of 55 studies on the relationship between climate and conflict that of all weather dimensions, temperature has the strongest impact on conflict.

**Economic growth and activity** @kalkuhl-wenz-2020-climate-on-grp, @linsenmeier-2023-temp-econ-dev-sfd, @marbler-2024-water-econ-activity

**Migration** @bohramishra-etal-2014-permanent-migration-climate perform a panel analysis, considering the effect of temperature and precipitation onto lagged shares of permanent emigration out of sub-national regions \["probability to migrate"\].
The authors find that the overall effects onto emigration are stronger for temperature than for precipitation.
They also compare this to lagged shares of permanent emigration resulting from natural disasters and find that \[...\].

**Urbanisation** A study that aims to relate climate change with shifts in rural and urban population amounts is from @barrios-etal-2006-rural-urban-mig-africa.
With the help of a cross-section analysis that considers the underlying multi-period panel data only in pooled format, the authors estimate that decreasing precipitation has increased urbanisation in Sub-Saharan Africa by \[...\] for every milliliter less of rainfall \[clarify the quantitative results, also which resolution\].
Similarly, @henderson-etal-2017-cc-urbanization-africa also investigate urbanisation.
**provide more background on the Henderson paper**

\[Name some papers (the same as mentioned just above or others) to make a differentiation by methodology, i.e. simple cross-section analysis, panel analysis, *spatial first differences* etc\]

*Cite those three mentioned in the @auffhammer-etal-2013-weather-data-econ-analysis paper:*

Among the first to introduce panel models in the context of estimation economic impacts of climate were Auffhammer, Ramanathan, and Vincent 2006; Deschenes and Greenstone 2007; Schlenker and Roberts 2009...
also quote Fisher et al (2012)

\[Differentiators to other, already published, literature:\]

-   its relatively small spatial resolution
-   the time span of the underlying data going relatively far back (first period 1961)
-   its panel nature allowing for control of many unobserved confounders with repeated influence stable in magnitude in every period
-   Unique in the geographical and economic area it covers, many studies seemed to have focused more on developing countries, using nightlights as a proxy for economic development. Using data from European sources, where independent statistical and meteorological institutions responsible for collecting the data underlying this study have been, at least historically, comparably strong and reliable.
-   To my knowledge, no one has so far pursued such a climate-related analysis with this exact population data set, particular contribution with geographical area it investigates (Europe) and the spatial level of detail

\[Further notes for myself\]

-   List literature that explore *Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)*
-   For my case, particularly the literature with a similar setup -- in terms of measures used for climate, population figure development as economic/subject area, econometric methodology making use of the additional time-dimension of the data, and the spatial dimension being relatively small (e.g. not entire countries)
