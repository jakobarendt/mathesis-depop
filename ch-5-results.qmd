## Simulated Impacts of Future Climate Change on Municipal Population Sizes

\[Provide graphs with past vs future population growth/decline rates.\]

\[Should be able to use climate projections from IPCC Global Climate Models (GCMs) or Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for predictions, look further under [http://www.ipcc-data.org/]().\]

To enable comparability among the projections of future climate and the GCMs & RCMs that calculate them, researchers have agreed on different CO~2~ emissions scenarios that the GCMs/RCMs take as exogenous.
For the same emissions scenario, projections and their underlying GCMs/RCMs therefore mainly differ in their ...

For a more detailed account on the differences, advantages and disadvantages of the different Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs), refer to @auffhammer-etal-2013-weather-data-econ-analysis.

After estimating the coefficients of the response functions of population response to climate, these results can now be used for extrapolation.
For predicting future climate impacts...
